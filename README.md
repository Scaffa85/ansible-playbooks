# ansible-playbooks

This repository contains any playbooks I've written, or edited (usually from Galaxy).

# ansible-create.py

This creates the directory structure from the ansible best common practices.

Run it in the playbook root, and pass '--role <new_role_name>' to build the structure for a new playbook.
